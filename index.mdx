## **Introduction**

We have Payment APIs which will make integrations much easier and seamless for you. If you have any queries, please write to [<u>developers@shadvalpay.co.in</u>](mailto:developers@shadvalpay.co.in)

The ShadvalPay APIs are RESTFUL. This means that every API has an oriented URL. Every URL accepts JSON request body and returns JSON-encoded responses. API supports POST and GET methods.

We also give response codes to denote success or failure for every API call. Only TXN and TUP responses should be treated as a success. Any other response codes should be treated as failures.

> ### 📘 **Prerequisites:**
>
> Run the following steps before you begin the integration:
>
> 1. Create the ShadvalPay Account.
